## Complaints Generation with LLMs
* Generate realistic and diverse complaints using Large Language Models tailored for complaint generation in the banking sector. These complaints serve as valuable data for future work, particularly for training classification models. The models are easily configurable and ready for immediate use. For more details, refer to the [model_card](https://github.com/stephvp1172/wells_fargo/)
