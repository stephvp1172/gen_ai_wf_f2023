I never received any mailing or notice about a decrease or any warning about it. the company did not even tell me, another identity theft protection plan I use told me about the credit decrease and the resulting increase in utilization rate. This is a violation of the fair credit reporting act because she stated that the reason they did so was because of payment delinquency ( not true ) which would required the notice. She said that the notice would be received in 7-10 days from TODAY, XX/XX/2022, which is days after this all apparently happened. \\n\\nI reached out to customer service and the lady was rude and said it was the credit agency 's fault and that she could not do anything. When I brought up that I was charged a late fee on XX/XX/XXXX, and then refunded that same late fee on the same date she got agitated. Then when i asked why I never received any notice or warning about it and she said that Citibank doesn't do that and wouldn't do it without telling people. I let her know that I never received any warning or notice and that literally another company which I pay to protect my identity were the only reason I found out. She said XXXX did the report but that doesn't mean that I shouldn't have been told about it. Then she hung up me when I asked about why i never received any letter or notice or anything about it. \\n\\nI don't care ultimately about the credit line or these nefarious people with suspect practices but I never was even told about it. no notice at all. it is not right. \\n\\nThen she hung up me when I asked about why i never received any letter or notice or anything about it. \\n\\nAlso the document and the website says i requested a cash advance which never happened.\",\n",
