    "* **max_length:** Model generates text until the output length (which includes the input context length) reaches `max_length`. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **max_new_tokens:** Model generates text until the output length (excluding the input context length) reaches `max_new_tokens`. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **num_beams:** Number of beams used in the greedy search. If specified, it must be integer greater than or equal to `num_return_sequences`.\n",
    "* **no_repeat_ngram_size:** Model ensures that a sequence of words of `no_repeat_ngram_size` is not repeated in the output sequence. If specified, it must be a positive integer greater than 1.\n",
    "* **temperature:** Controls the randomness in the output. Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.\n",
    "* **early_stopping:** If True, text generation is finished when all beam hypotheses reach the end of sentence token. If specified, it must be boolean.\n",
    "* **do_sample:** If True, sample the next word as per the likelihood. If specified, it must be boolean.\n",
    "* **top_k:** In each step of text generation, sample from only the `top_k` most likely words. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **top_p:** In each step of text generation, sample from the smallest possible set of words with cumulative probability `top_p`. If specified, it must be a float between 0 and 1.\n",
    "* **return_full_text:** If True, input text will be part of the output generated text. If specified, it must be boolean. The default value for it is False.\n",
    "* **stop**: If specified, it must a list of strings. Text generation stops if any one of the specified strings is generated.\n",

      "Original Complaint: 'I encountered a hardship situation XX/XX/XXXX. I had an XXXX credit score then, and I try to convey my problem to the citi representatives asking for help. I was struggling making all my payments and staying current with everything that went on in my live then. Citi bank told me that I did n't qualify for a refinance because my property was underwater. They could not help me. I defaulted in my loan months later, then Citi back was willing to work with me and send me a package to apply for a loan modification HAMP or any other program available. The process was not easy the representatives assigned to me kept changing and they kept asking for documents over and over again. However it seems like they never reached the right person on time. The excused was many times \" it was probably stock in the fax memory. We have closed the file and you have to reapply. '' If you do an investigation on my case my file was closed and opened more than XXXX times in a period of XXXX years. They did not communicate well at all. I finally got fed up and I hired a layer to help me. {$4000.00} later the lawyer got them to send me a denial letter XX/XX/XXXX. They denied me because the bank that owns my loan does not participate in any of the programs available. XXXX Bank does not participate in any programs available set by my government to help owners keep their primary property. They also denied me because I did not have enough income to cover the payments. I was never refusing to pay I have never wanted a free ride. I am hard working woman that encountered a few set backs and I was asking for help. I had my job for 10 years, I have been helping the economy since I came XXXX 20 years ago. I pay taxes like everyonelse does and I had had to work XXXX and XXXX jobs to make my obligations. Citi bank took three years to tell me that I was never going to get a loan modification to begin with. Instead, they led me on for three years occurring fees, interest, and penalties. My XXXX credit score is ruined. My debt to Citi is so big now that I ca n't even think of repaying. As a matter of fact the only program they offered was a repayment plan. I needed to come up with {$35000.00} with 30 days of the denial letter was issued. They never told me that my monthly payment was going to change. I decided I was going to try to keep my home, I do n't want to lose it. I took a XXXX job, I rented the XXXX floor of my property and I was going to borrow the {$35000.00} from a relative all in order to take the \" only option they gave me to retain my home. When I call to let them know that I wanted to take that option and I gave them my new numbers, they denied me intermediately. The representative said even with the {$35000.00} I would not be able to afford the new monthly payment because I had accrue penalties, fees, interest and attorneys fees. I asked how much is it? He could not tell me, but I did not qualified. My other options were short sell and/or deed in lieu of foreclosure. He try to entice me into going to the second choice he said by giving the property back to the bank I could qualify for some reallocation money. If I take the short sale the bank would not give me any reallocation money. I took the short sale option. Then he said that I have to write a letter saying that \" I do n't want to keep my home. That I have refused any retention program they have offered me '' in order to qualify for a short sell. They asked me to lie in a document. I am so sad and sick of the way this bank have treated me and others, I hope I do n't get sick from the stress. This bank instead of helping me with my hardship they have created a bigger one for me. My credit is ruined, and I am losing my home of 10 years, and they want me to lie in order to attempt to short sell my home. I want to keep my home and fix my credit. Please help me.'\n",

There was no letter explaining what would be my next steps or what would be the burden of proof to retrieve funds, and how long would it take. This is NOT how a bank is supposed to function. Are our regulations as such that a citizen can not keep funds in a bank for extended period of time without any activity?

I was struggling making all my payments and staying current with everything that went on in my live then. Citi bank told me that I did n't qualify for a refinance because my property was underwater. They could not help me. I defaulted in my loan months later, then Citi back was willing to work with me and send me a package to apply for a loan modification HAMP or any other program available. The process was not easy the representatives assigned to me kept changing and they kept asking for documents over and over again. However it seems like they never reached the right person on time.

XXXX Bank does not participate in any programs available set by my government to help owners keep their primary property. They also denied me because I did not have enough income to cover the payments. I was never refusing to pay I have never wanted a free ride.

My XXXX credit score is ruined. My debt to Citi is so big now that I ca n't even think of repaying. As a matter of fact the only program they offered was a repayment plan. I needed to come up with {$35000.00} with 30 days of the denial letter was issued. They never told me that my monthly payment was going to change. I decided I was going to try to keep my home, I do n't want to lose it.

When I call to let them know that I wanted to take that option and I gave them my new numbers, they denied me intermediately. The representative said even with the {$35000.00} I would not be able to afford the new monthly payment because I had accrue penalties, fees, interest and attorneys fees. I asked how much is it? He could not tell me, but I did not qualified. My other options were short sell and/or deed in lieu of foreclosure. He try to entice me into going to the second choice he said by giving the property back to the bank I could qualify for some reallocation money. If I take the short sale the bank would not give me any reallocation money. I took the short sale option. Then he said that I have to write a letter saying that \" I do n't want to keep my home.

I am so sad and sick of the way this bank have treated me and others, I hope I do n't get sick from the stress. This bank instead of helping me with my hardship they have created a bigger one for me.
